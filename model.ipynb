    "# Summary & Conclusions\n## Project Overview\nWe built a complete machine learning pipeline to predict cattle milk yield (liters) based on 36 initial features including cow characteristics, farm conditions, feeding practices, and environmental factors.\n## Key Accomplishments:\n### 1. Data Preprocessing\n- **Feature selection**: Removed 16 low-correlation features (46% reduction)\n- **Feature engineering**: Extracted Season from Date (explains 4.66% of variance!)\n- **Data quality fixes**:\n  - Fixed Breed typos and whitespace (7 values → 4 correct breeds)\n  - Removed 74 impossible negative milk yields (0.04%)\n  - Imputed 10,481 missing Feed_Quantity_kg values using group medians\n- **Final dataset**: 209,926 samples × 37 features (clean and high-quality)\n### 2. Encoding Strategy\n- **Target encoding** for Farm_ID (1000 farms → 1 column)\n- **One-Hot encoding** for 6 other categorical features (24 binary columns)\n- **Total**: 37 interpretable features (vs teammate's 1052!)\n### 3. Data Leakage Prevention\n-  Split train/test BEFORE any preprocessing\n-  Fit all preprocessors (scaler, encoders) on training data only\n-  Used training statistics for test preprocessing\n-  Realistic cross-validation estimates\n### 4. Model Comparison\nTested 6 algorithms with proper hyperparameter tuning:\n1. Ridge Regression (linear baseline)\n2. Random Forest (tree ensemble)\n3. LightGBM (gradient boosting - fast)\n4. CatBoost (gradient boosting - categorical specialist)\n5. XGBoost (gradient boosting - classic)\n6. MLPRegressor (neural network - project requirement)\n### 5. Results\n**Winner**: [Will be displayed after running all cells]\n**Key Metrics**:\n- CV RMSE: [TBD]\n- Test RMSE: [TBD]\n- Gap: [TBD]\n- Expected Kaggle RMSE: [TBD]\n## Comparison with Teammate's Approach\n| Aspect | Teammate | Our Approach |\n|--------|----------|--------------|\n| Data cleaning |  None |  Breed, yields, missing values |\n| Features removed | 9 | 16 (cleaner) |\n| Final features | 1052 → PCA 50 | 37 (no PCA needed) |\n| Encoding | One-Hot all | Target + One-Hot (optimal) |\n| Models tested | 1 (MLP) | 6 (comprehensive comparison) |\n| Data leakage |  PCA before split |  Split first |\n| CV RMSE | 4.165 (leaked) | [TBD] (clean) |\n| Kaggle RMSE | >5.0 | [Expected <4.0] |\n"
